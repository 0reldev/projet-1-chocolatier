# ChocoWild

## Educational project 1 from Wild Code School

### Introduction

During the second week of the Wild Code School web developper training session, a first project is proposed to work on in teams.
Our team was composed of three people, all beginners, and the project duration was three days.

### Goals

 - The purpose of this project is to design a **static website** for a shop by only using **HTML** and **CSS**. 

 - Furthermore, the project is organized in teams with a required use of **Git**.

 - Finally, the website has to be **responsive** and mobile-first.

### Presentation of the website

#### Home page

##### Mobile version

The home page diplays a header section containing the logo and the company's headline. 

A burger menu opens on click for the navigation in the differents pages of the web site. 

A caroussel shows a selection of chocolate photos, examples of products that the shop con propose.

Then, some articles are shown in a single column presenting news from the company.

In the end, the footer shows in a column some contact informations and social networks links.

##### Desktop version

When display in the website on a desktop, the navigation bar changes into a traditionnal navbar instead of a burger menu. 

The caroussel and the articles boxes adapt to the large screen, and the footer content is split into several columns.
